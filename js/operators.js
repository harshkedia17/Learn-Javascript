// ! difference between == and ===
// ? == only checks the value and not the data type and is lossy
// * === checks the value and the data type and is strict
// ! example
let a = 1;
let b = "1";

console.log(a === b); //false

// ! differnce between != and !==
// * same as above != checks only value and !== checks value and data type

 * !Falsy values

 * * null
 * * undefined
 * * NaN
